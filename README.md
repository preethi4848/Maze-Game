MAZE GAME :

Made with love ❤️ by PREETHI G

HTML and CSS are important building blocks in web development, but JavaScript is the
programming language that moves websites from function to fun. So it’s no surprise
that games are on the list of fun JavaScript projects that let you practice your skills
without falling asleep at the keyboard.

I mada a Maze Game using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, movements are
done using Keyboard controls ( Arrow Keys or W, A, S, D Keys for movement ). Each
level has different mazes which are generated randomly. Now talking about the
environment, the game design is set on Canvas.

For the development of this simple web-based gaming project, no any Image is used, it
is developed using JavaScript to bring the final output. All the gaming functions are set
from Javascript whereas HTML and CSS are set for the layouts and other minor
functions.

FEATURES :

● Here the player has to escape from the maze within a given time.

● There are 5 levels, you can't skip the level. After the completion on one level, you can move to next level.

● Insert Obstacles in the grid to make the game interesting.
